# Exploration-4
For my Exploration 4 I learned about the build automation tool Jenkins.
 I've seen many possitions that have experience with Jenkins as a preferred qualification.
 [This listing is an example of such.](https://www.glassdoor.com/job-listing/full-stack-developer-senior-software-engineer-altisource-JV_IC1148170_KO0,45_KE46,56.htm?jl=1659881431)
 
 To explore Jenkins I decided to configure a job that would email me every day.  This explores the ability to use Jenkins as an automation software and some of Jenkins general features.  Being able to run arbitrary shell scrips is an extreamly powerfull feature that I wasn't aware of. Because of this exploration I will be installing Jenkins on my home server to automate tasks on my home network.  A majority of this exersise was devoted to reading the [Use Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Use+Jenkins) page. I found this to be extreamly usefull because it has given me a good overview of what Jenkins can be used for.
 
 My Jenkins installation can be found [here](http://cs4830.cloudapp.net:8081/)
